The NOSQL Ontology
===================
This ontology contains a hierarchy of NOSQL databases, and some related properties.
The hierarchy includes classes for NOSQL databases, KeyValue, Document, Columnar, Graph and Multimodal.
Each has several databases in sub-classes, e.g., Redis, MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4J and ArangoDB, for each class respectively.
It also groups the query languages for several NOSQL databses, e.g., CQL, HQL, AQL and Cypher.
Miscellaneous categories about how each database calls a specific concept, e.g., indexes, primary keys, viewers; and what is an entity in each database, .e.g., table, collection, data bucket, etc.

The ontology namespace is [http://purl.org/db/nosql#](NOSQL), and its prefix is **nosql**.
